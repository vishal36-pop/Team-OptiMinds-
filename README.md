# Team-OptiMinds-
This project develops a mathematical optimization  framework for minimizing production cost across multiple ma chines with strict capacity limits and uncertain demand. Unlike  models that assume fixed demand, our approach incorporates  stochastic variability and ensures reliability through convex  optimization. Using Lagrangian and KKT analysis
